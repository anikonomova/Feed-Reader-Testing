# Feed Reader Testing

## Overview

That project is a part of the Udacity's FEND Nanodegree.That's a web-based application that reads RSS feeds with included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).And the tests are:

1. 'RSS feed' suite - tests if the allFeeds variable, the URL and the name are defined and not empty.
2. 'The menu' suite - tests the default hidden menu and that it changes visibility when clicked on the menu icon.
3. 'Initial entries' suite - checks if the loadFeed function works properly.
4. 'New feed selection' suite - checks if the loadFeed function works properly and actually changes the content.

## How to run?
Clone or download the repository and just start the index.html file in your browser.
